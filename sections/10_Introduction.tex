Necessity of Solar Panel Deployment System \\
Current Hinge Designs\\
Door hinge: \\
	Typical hinge, torsion springs. Galling and cold welding concerns. Structurally qualified for every satellite... 
Tape measure steel hinge\\
	proven on large satellites. Typically consists of hardware springs steel. Scalability is limited by adding more of the same material. We donâ€™t know the properties of the steel, must be requalified every time for use. \\
	Difficult to scale\\
	Re-qualify before every use. Mechanical properties: Spring constant (moment angle relationship), deployment impulse and time, stiffness and damping coefficient. \\

What are we doing: We developed a novel hinge housing for sheet spring steel with similar qualities as a tape spring steel but 


Solid State Hinge as Solution to Cubesat Solar Panel Deployment
Complete qualification to reduce repetitive costs subsat teams face on every deployment design.
